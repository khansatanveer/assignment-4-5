              It is officially that time of year... FALL! Although South Florida 
         until December,it is still Fall in my eyes.
        
    Fall time calls for soup have mastered thesethree recipes over
     
    the  last couple of years and can not wait to see how they turn 

    out for everyone. The recipes below are not fully mine, over 
       
    the years I have found some online and switched them up in a
        
    few  ways, swapped ingredients, and modified them to my taste.
       
    If you make any of the recipes I would LOVE and stew.
        
    I personally am a HUGE soup lover so
